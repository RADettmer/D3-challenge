# D3 Challenge - D3 Data Journalism


In this assignment, an interactive scatter plot was created to explore data from the 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. (American FactFinder has been decommissioned and this data is no longer available.) 
This data includes data on rates of income, age, obesity, poverty, smokes and lack of health insurance.
