# D3 Challenge - D3 Data Journalism


In this assignment, an interactive scatter plot was created to explore data from the 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. (American FactFinder has been decommissioned and this data is no longer available.) 
This data includes data on rates of income, age, obesity, poverty, smokes and lack of health insurance.

## Observations and Inferences

Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income for the data from 2014.
The initial review of these scatter plots, you will notice that Mississippi seems to have several risk factors stacked against it. They lead the US in the amount of obesity (35.5%), 21.5% of their residence live in poverty and it comes in second (after Georgia) with 18.8% of their residence lacking health insurance.

Some other quick observations to note. Although Kentucky and West Virginia have high smoking rates, 26.2% and 26.7% respectfully, on the other hand, only 10% in Kentucky and 10.1% in West Virginia lack health insurance. In addition, their average household income is very close for both, $42,958 for Kentucky and $41,059 for West Virginia.

Nearly a quarter (24.9%) of the population in Texas lacks health care while only 17.2% are in poverty. Maryland has the highest median household income of $73,971 but only 9.7% of the residence lack health insurance. In Utah, 17.7% of the population is in poverty but only 9.7% smoke. Maine has the highest median age at 44.1 and has a 28.2% obesity rate.
