D3 DATA JOURNALISM


In this assignment, an interactive scatter plot was created to explore data from the 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

This data included data on rates of income, age, obesity, poverty, smokes and lack of health insurance.

THOUGHTS:

This was a challenging but cool assignment.  It was difficult thinking through the process but fun figuring out the colors and layout.

The most difficult but rewarding was getting the gauge to work.  I think I spent the most time on this fiddling with the color scheme.

If you notice, the delta in the gauge changes to up and green once the subject, like name 956 does, once the washing frequency goes above 5.
