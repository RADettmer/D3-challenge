          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>The initial review of these scatter plots, you will notice that Mississippi seems to have several risk factors 
            stacked against it. They lead the US in the amount of obesity (35.5%), 21.5% of their residence live in poverty
            and it comes in second (after Georgia) with 18.8% of their residence lacking health insurance.</p>

          <p>Some other quick observations to note. Although Kentucky and West Virginia have high smoking rates, 26.2% and 26.7%
            respectfully, on the other hand, only 10% in Kentucky and 10.1% in West Virginia lack health insurance. In addition, 
            their average household income is very close for both, $42,958 for Kentucky and $41,059 for West Virginia.
          </p>

          <p>Nearly a quarter (24.9%) of the population in Texas lacks health care while only 17.2% are in poverty. Maryland has
            the highest median household income of $73,971 but only 9.7% of the residence lack health insurance. In Utah, 17.7%
            of the population is in poverty but only 9.7% smoke. Maine has the highest median age at 44.1 and has 28.2% obesity.
